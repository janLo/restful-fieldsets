[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/janLo/restful-fieldsets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/janLo/restful-fieldsets)

This is an extension to the [Flask-RESTful](http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
module to build fieldsets similar to [WTForm](http://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) forms
for the response marshalling.
