# Flask-RESTful-Fieldsets

This is an extension to the [Flask-RESTful](http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
module to build fieldsets similar to [WTForm](http://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) forms
for the response marshalling.

Read the docstring documentation to get a description how it can be used.
